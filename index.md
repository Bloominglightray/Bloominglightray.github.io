Hello! I am an aspiring researcher passionate about exploring AI4Science, Reasoning, and multimodal LLMs. I am currently a Senior Undergraduate in Computer Science at NYU Shanghai, actively seeking opportunities to pursue original research and contribute to these rapidly evolving fields.

**Research Interests:**
- **AI4Science**: Applying artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery and research processes
- **Reasoning**: Developing AI systems with enhanced logical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities
- **Multimodal LLMs**: Exploring large language models that can process and understand multiple types of data simultaneously

**Current Research:**
I am currently working with **Professor Chen Zhao** at NYU Shanghai on **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and QA systems**, focusing on improving information retrieval and question-answering capabilities. Additionally, I am collaborating with **Yale NLP** under **Professor Arman Cohan** and **Professor John Sous** in the field of **AI4Physics**, exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics research.
