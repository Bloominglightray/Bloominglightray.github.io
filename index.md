Hello! I am an aspiring researcher passionate about exploring **AI4Science**, **Reasoning**, and **Multimodal LLMs**. I am currently a Senior Undergraduate in Computer Science at NYU Shanghai, actively seeking opportunities to pursue original research and contribute to these rapidly evolving fields.

<div class="research-interests">
<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI4Science</strong>: Applying artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery and research processes</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning</strong>: Developing AI systems with enhanced logical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities</li>
<li><strong>Multimodal LLMs</strong>: Exploring large language models that can process and understand multiple types of data simultaneously</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Current Research

I am currently working with **Professor Chen Zhao** at NYU Shanghai on **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and QA systems**, focusing on improving information retrieval and question-answering capabilities. Additionally, I am collaborating with **Yale NLP** under **Professor Arman Cohan** and **Professor John Sous** in the field of **AI4Physics**, exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics research.
