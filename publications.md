### Peer-reviewed Conference Papers

#### "PHYSICS: Benchmarking Foundation Models on University-Level Physics Problem Solving"
*Kaiyue Feng\**, Yilun Zhao*, Yixin Liu, Tianyu Yang, Chen Zhao, John Sous, Arman Cohan*  
*Accepted at ACL 2025 (Findings)*

**Abstract:** This paper introduces PHYSICS, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating foundation models on university-level physics problem solving. We collect and annotate a diverse dataset of physics problems and evaluate state-of-the-art language models on their reasoning capabilities.

**Key Contributions:**
- Created the first large-scale benchmark for university-level physics problem solving
- Evaluated multiple foundation models on complex physics reasoning tasks
- Provided insights into model capabilities and limitations in scientific reasoning

#### "RAG-Augmented Reasoning for Multi-Modal Question Answering" *(Under Review)*
*Kaiyue Feng\**, Siyue Zhang*, Bingsen Chen, Yilun Zhao, Chen Zhao*  
*Submitted to EMNLP 2025*

**Abstract:** We propose a novel approach to multi-modal question answering using retrieval-augmented generation techniques. Our method improves question-answering accuracy by incorporating relevant context from multiple modalities.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed RAG-based approach for multi-modal QA
- Improved accuracy on domain-specific question answering
- Created evaluation framework for multi-modal reasoning systems
